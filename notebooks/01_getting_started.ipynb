    "## 1. Introduction to FIA Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is FIA?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA)** program is the nation's forest census, conducted by the USDA Forest Service. It provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comprehensive coverage**: Every U.S. state and territory\n",
    "- **Consistent methodology**: Standardized protocols since the 1930s\n",
    "- **Annual updates**: Rotating panel design means ~20% of plots measured each year\n",
    "- **Rich detail**: Tree species, size, health, ownership, and more\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use FIA Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "FIA is the authoritative source for questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How much forest exists in a state?\n",
    "- What tree species are most common?\n",
    "- How much timber volume is available?\n",
    "- How fast are forests growing or declining?\n",
    "- What's the carbon stored in forest biomass?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "FIA data is powerful but complex:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple interconnected tables (PLOT, TREE, COND, etc.)\n",
    "- Complex sampling design requires proper statistical estimation\n",
    "- Evaluation cycles and panel structures can be confusing\n",
    "\n",
    "**pyFIA simplifies all of this** with a clean Python API that handles the complexity for you."
